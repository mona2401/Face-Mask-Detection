# Face-Mask-Detection
#### This project is for detection of people face and show whether he/she is wearing mask.

#### This project I have done by two ways one using Simple CNN While loss is categorical cross-entropy.
#### The second way is using Transfer Learning while loss is binary cross-entropy.
#### The dataset used here was made by  Prajna Bhandary. It contains images of people wearing mask and not wearing mask.
#### with_mask: 690 images
#### without_mask: 686 images
Here are the steps to make this model.
#### 1. Load the Dataset from your device(I'm used Goggle colab here for my project).
#### 2. Import the necessary Libraries.
#### 3. Labelling the images(For EX: 0 for with_mask and 1 for without_mask).
#### 4. Train the classifier using CNN and other is using VGG16.
#### 5. Save your model into your local device.
#### 6. For Detection of image run the code of imgdetect.py
#### 7. For Real time Detection run Real_time_detection.py

#### I have attached an PPT for understanding how the models works. You can go thriugh that.
